# Prototyping v2

This is a suggestion for a new prototyping app. I've attempted to heavily streamline the old app.

## Get started

I've pre-populated the prototyping app with a guide and a quick answer.

Just pick the one you need and duplicate the folder (preferably also in a new branch).

In that folder, just use `sass --watch proto.scss:proto.css` to start generating your CSS files. Alternatively you can use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) or [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/). CodeKit is both simpler and has more features. It costs $25. LiveReload is slightly more complex to set up but costs just $10.

## Why?

* The old prototyping app got very slow as people added stuff.
* Steep learning curve for non-devs. (We want designers coding, right?)
